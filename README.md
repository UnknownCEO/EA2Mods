# Please Read!

Note that Executive Assault 2 does NOT have official mod support. As a result, mods are likely to be buggy and sometimes break things. Please **uninstall Unity Mod Manager** (using the "Uninstall" button in UMM) **before testing for bugs in the game** to be sure that only bugs caused by the base game are reported to the developer of EA2.

**Report problems with a mod to the person who made the mod, not the game developer.**

## Available Mods

Here is a list of the mods I have created:

##### Bridge Forcefields on Red Alert (BFoRA)
When BFoRA is active, your bridge forcefields will automatically be turned on when red alert is activated on your space station. The forcefields will remain on until you manually turn them off or the generators are destroyed.

## Installing Unity Mod Manager
Mods are installed using [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21). To install Unity Mod Manager,

* Download Unity Mod Manager from the [Files tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21?tab=files) at the above link or use the [Dropbox mirror](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wz8x8e4onjdfdbm/UnityModManager.zip?dl=1) they provide if you don't want to download from NexusMods.
* Unzip the downloaded zip file. 
* Download the custom mod manager config (go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnknownCEO/EA2Mods/master/UnityModManagerConfig.xml), right click the page and choose "Save as" or whatever similar option you have) and replace the original `UnityModManagerConfig.xml` with the one you just downloaded.
* Launch `UnityModManager.exe`.
* Select Executive Assault 2 from the dropdown "Game" selector.
* The mod manager should automatically detect your game folder. If it doesn't, the game folder can usually be found at `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Executive Assault 2` or somewhere similar.
* Click "Install" to install the mod manager.
* If everything has worked correctly, you should be able to launch Executive Assault 2 and have a mod manager window pop up when the main menu loads.

## Installing Mods
To install a mod you can do either of the following:
1. Drag the zipped mod folder into the "Mods" tab of Unity Mod Manager.
2. Unzip the zipped mod folder and place the unzipped folder in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Executive Assault 2\Mods`.

## Using Mods
The Unity Mod Manager menu window can be opened by pressing `LCtrl + F10`. This menu can be used to be activate and deactivate mods. Some mods may also support settings that can be customized in this menu.
