# Please Read!

Note that Executive Assault 2 does NOT have official mod support. As a result, mods are likely to be buggy and sometimes break things. Please **uninstall Unity Mod Manager** (using the "Uninstall" button in UMM) **before testing for bugs in the game** to be sure that only bugs caused by the base game are reported to the developer of EA2.

**Report problems with a mod to the person who made the mod, not the game developer.**

## Available Mods

Here is a list of the mods I have created so far:

#### Bridge Forcefields on Red Alert (BFoRA)
When BFoRA is active, your bridge forcefields will automatically be turned on when red alert is activated on your space station. The forcefields will remain on until you manually turn them off or the generators are destroyed.

_Works in multiplayer._

#### Time Warp
Time Warp allows you to speed up and slow down the game. Use the mod manager menu to set the desired game speed multiplier. For example, setting the multiplier to 2 will make the game run 2x faster. Setting the multiplier to 0.5 will make the game run at half speed.

_Should work in multiplayer with other players who have the mod installed and enabled._

## Installing Unity Mod Manager
Mods are installed using [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21). To install Unity Mod Manager,

* Download Unity Mod Manager from the [Files tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21?tab=files) at the above link or use the mirror they provide if you don't want to download from NexusMods.
* Unzip the downloaded zip file. 
* ~~Download the custom mod manager config (go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnknownCEO/EA2Mods/master/UnityModManagerConfig.xml), right click the page and choose "Save as" or whatever similar option you have) and replace the original `UnityModManagerConfig.xml` with the one you just downloaded.~~ The mod manager has been updated and this step should no longer be necessary.
* Launch `UnityModManager.exe`.
* Select Executive Assault 2 from the dropdown "Game" selector.
* The mod manager should automatically detect your game folder. If it doesn't, the game folder can usually be found at `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Executive Assault 2` or somewhere similar.
* Click "Install" to install the mod manager.
* If everything has worked correctly, you should be able to launch Executive Assault 2 and have a mod manager window pop up when the main menu loads.

## Installing Mods
To install a mod you can do either of the following:
1. Drag the zipped mod folder into the "Mods" tab of Unity Mod Manager.
2. Unzip the zipped mod folder and place the unzipped folder in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Executive Assault 2\Mods`.

## Using Mods
The Unity Mod Manager menu window can be opened by pressing `LCtrl + F10`. This menu can be used to be activate and deactivate mods. Some mods may also support settings that can be customized in this menu.
